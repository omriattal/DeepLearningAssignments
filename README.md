# Topics in Deep Learning Assignments

This repository consists the three assignments we did in the course "Topics in Deep Learning" in Ben-Gurion University.

## Assignments
1. Train pytorch's CNN from the 60-minutes blitz course.
2. Implement our own ANN/RNN/LSTM layers using pytorch.
3. Use the layers we built in assignment 2 to build ANN/RNN/LSTM networks for the copy task problem.

Each assignment had an analysis part which is added in a PDF format and was written in Python with Pytorch library.
